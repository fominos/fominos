## Projects

### Advanced AI Systems & Computer Vision

*   **Document Stamp & Signature Detection API**
    Engineered a production-ready FastAPI service utilizing a fine-tuned YOLO model. Enhanced model accuracy by training on 1,100 real documents, adding new signature recognition capabilities for automated document verification.
*   **Smart Document Processing API**
    Developed an intelligent document analysis system that processes contracts and transportation documents using Yandex Vision OCR, YandexGPT for entity extraction, and RAG technology for large documents. Implements complex business logic for compliance validation and stamp/signature analysis.
*   **AI-Generated Image Detection Bot**
    Created a Telegram bot that analyzes images to classify them as real or artificially generated, demonstrating expertise in image classification models.
*   **Multimodal Art Analysis Bot** *(Diploma Project)*
    Developed a Telegram bot that performs multifaceted analysis of artworks. The AI solution distinguishes origin (human/AI-generated), classifies artistic style, detects emotional content, and generates comprehensive descriptions by combining Computer Vision and NLP techniques.

### Machine Learning & Data Analysis

*   **Hotel Guest Segmentation & Recommendation System** *(Academic Practice)*
    Conducted comprehensive customer segmentation for a hotel chain using K-means clustering, identifying 7 distinct guest profiles. Built a personalized marketing strategy and a recommendation system using a RandomForest classifier to optimize guest offers.

*   **Mushroom Edibility Prediction Bot** *(Personal Project)*
    Created an ML-powered bot that classifies mushroom edibility based on user-input characteristics, demonstrating practical application of supervised learning.

### Process Automation & Data Pipelines

*   **Telegram Bot for Logistics (Truck Radar)**
    Developed a Python bot to streamline logistics operations by automating order and payment data collection, saving it to Google Sheets, and improving communication between dispatchers and managers.
