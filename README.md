## Hi, I'm Katia ðŸ‘‹
A recently qualified Data Scientist passionate about turning data into insights and building intelligent applications.

### Education and Qualification

I have successfully completed professional retraining in Data Science and obtained my diploma in April 2025. The comprehensive program covered the following key areas:

<li> Fundamentals of Analytics and Statistics
<li> Data visualization fundamentals
<li> SQL and Data Retrieval
<li> Python Basics and Libraries for Data Analysis
<li> Statistics and Big Data Analytics
<li> Mathematics for Data Science
<li> Feature Engineering and Model Building
<li> Time Series Analysis
<li> Recommender Systems
<li> Computer Vision
<li> Natural Language Processing
<li> Data project management
<li> Deep Learning</li>

### Projects
During and after my Data Science training, I have implemented several practical projects that demonstrate the application of acquired skills:
***
1. <b> Telegram Bot for Truck Radar:</b> Developed a Python bot that streamlines logistics operations by collecting order information and payment requests, automatically saving data to Google Sheets, and facilitating communication between dispatchers and managers.
2. <b>Telegram Bot for Mushroom Edibility Prediction:</b>
Created an ML-powered bot that analyzes mushroom characteristics using a classification model to determine edibility, showcasing practical implementation of supervised learning.
3. <b>Telegram Bot for Image Analysis:</b>
Implemented a bot that analyzes images to determine if they are real or generated by artificial intelligence.
4. <b>Hotel Guest Segmentation Analysis:</b>
Conducted comprehensive customer segmentation for Hotels chain using K-means clustering, identifying 7 distinct guest segments based on demographic and behavioral patterns. Developed personalized marketing strategies and a recommendation system using RandomForest classifier for targeted guest offers.
5. <b>Telegram Bot for Art Analysis:</b>
Developed a multimodal AI solution that analyzes artwork to identify origin (human/AI-generated), artistic style, emotional content, and generates comprehensive descriptions using combined CV and NLP approaches.
6. <b>Document Stamp & Signature Detection API:</b>
Developed a production-ready FastAPI service that uses a fine-tuned YOLO model to detect stamps and signatures in documents. The model was enhanced through training on 1,100 real documents, significantly improving detection accuracy and adding new signature recognition capabilities.
7. <b>Smart Document Processing API:</b>
Developed an intelligent document analysis system that processes contracts and transportation documents using Yandex Vision OCR, YandexGPT for entity extraction, and RAG technology for large documents. Implements complex business logic for compliance validation and stamp/signature analysis.
